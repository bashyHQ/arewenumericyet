<h2>Compiler: rustc</h2>

 LLVM is one of best open source/free software compiler frameworks. Hence your simple code will inherit many important optimizations. rustc itself converts many high level abstractions such as variables, trait based generic code and iterators into machine friendly forms such as on-stack allocations, specialized code and simple loops.

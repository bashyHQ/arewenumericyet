## Introduction

This work in progress is a first cut at a site introducing the Rust ecosystem for writing numeric code, and referencing related libraries and projects. Feel free to help us reference your project by letting us know about it. If you library is on crates.io, give it a numeric tag and we will find it eventually.


## Some numeric crates:
The following have been added to our tracking index (and the website where appropriate)

- [ndarray](https://crates.io/crates/ndarray)  (0.4.9)
- [asprim](https://crates.io/crates/asprim)  (0.1.0)

Anything we missed? [Let us know](https://github.com/bashyHQ/arewenumericyet/issues/new)!

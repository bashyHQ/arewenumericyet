    Freelance OpenSource Software Architect and Developer


    I design, build and supervise the building of software (systems). Sometimes for clients, often times on my own, whenever possible as OpenSource. I care about good design in both, the User Experience and backend architecture and infrastructure. And I write about all this stuff.
